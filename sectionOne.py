# Lecture 1: Welcome!

# Welcome to Introduction to Computer Science in Python!
# My name is Zackary and I will be your lecturer throughout
# the duration of the course. Together, we will tackle what
# it takes to get started in a career in programming, and 
# learn all that we can about the Python language along the way.
# In this course, we will start from the very beginning, and 
# get you through the beginner level so that you are at a 
# college level of understanding when you are finished.
# Each section involves theory and live code demonstration
# lectures, along with assignments. You will also have my
# notes to reference the whole way so that you can't get lost,
# and always have addition reference materials. Lets get 
# started!


# Lecture 2: 

# Alright lets get started by doing some installs. 
#
# 1. First, go to
# https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download and 
# install  the correct version for your computer.
#
# 2. When that is finished, download and install the latest 
# version of python, which for me is currently 3.12.4, from
# https://www.python.org/downloads/
#
# 3. Download and install GitHub Desktop from
# https://desktop.github.com/download/ and we'll come back to 
# it at the end of the section


# Lecture 3: Getting started with Visual Studio Code

# As long as we installed everything correctly, vscode 
# will be ready for us to get started with python.
# Over on the left we have our workspace. To get set up well,
# we'll want to open the folder we want to work from. You
# can create this on your desktop or wherever you like,
# just drag it into the space and click add to workspace.
# Now we're ready for the print function. It prints to the 
# console whatever you like, you just have to use it properly.
# For now, just copy what is here and run it in the 
# terminal using ctr & f5 together and selecting python
# debugger if necessary. You should only have to do this once. 

print('Hello World!')
